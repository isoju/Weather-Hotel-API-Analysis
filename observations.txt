3 observable trends/analyses

1) Max temperature is higher in cities closer to the equator than those further 
from the equator.

2) According to the data retrieved, humidity seems to be constant and high 
no matter where the city is located on the world map, with a trend nearing 80% humidity.

3) According to the data retrieved, there cannot be a general ultimate conclusion when 
observing the data pertaining to the relationship between latitude and cloudiness. It
seems to be a case-by-case scenario, and hence, no trend can be observed at this time.
